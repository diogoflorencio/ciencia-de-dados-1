This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stargazer)
library(caret)

speed_dating = read_csv("dados/speed-dating2.csv") %>% 
  select(dec, gender, age, age_o, fun, attr, fun) %>% 
  mutate(diff_age = age - age_o,
         dec = case_when( .$dec == "no" ~ 0,
                          .$dec == "yes" ~ 1)) %>% 
  select(-age, -age_o)

summary(speed_dating)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggpairs(speed_dating)
```


```{r}
logit <- glm(dec ~ gender + fun + attr + diff_age, data = speed_dating, family = "binomial")
summary(logit)
```
